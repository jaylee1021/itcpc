# ITCPC Church Home

Welcome to ITCPC Church Homepage!  ITCPC Church Home offers a dynamic web application designed to facilitate seamless communication within the church community. Through this platform, members and non-members alike can access a wealth of resources, including Sermons, Events, Photos, and more.

The application is meticulously crafted using the powerful MERN stack, incorporating MongoDB for robust data storage, ExpressJS for a streamlined backend, React and NextJS for an intuitive user interface, and NodeJS to ensure optimal server-side functionality.
